# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GvUktU5.png" width="30"/> AIOLists Stremio Addon (for arm64)

AIOLists is a stateless open source list management addon for Stremio. The project originated from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1kbfk67/concept_for_an_aiolist_addon/), since then I have continued development to add features I would personally want in a list management addon, and fixed bugs shared by the users.

# âœ¨ Features
- **Unified List Management:** Import and manage lists from various sources in one place.
- **Unified Search:** Choose between Cinemeta, Trakt, TMDB or all 3 aggregated search.
- **Metadata:** Choose between Cinemeta or TMDB metadata, and choose between one of their extensive set of supported languages.
- **MDBList & Trakt URL Imports:** Directly import lists by pasting URLs from MDBList.com and Trakt.tv no API key or connection needed.
- **Trakt Integration:** Connect your Trakt account to access personal lists, watchlist, recommendations, trending, and popular content.
- **MDBList Integration:** Enter your MDBList API Key and import all your personal lists and watchlists into one place.
- **External Lists from Addon:** From letterboxd to anime lists import manifest.json from any external addon into AIOLists.
- **Sorting:** If the sorting option exists it's there.
- **List Customization:**
    - **Change type:** Instead of movies/series change it to whatever you want, even make it blank.
    - **Reorder:** Drag and drop to arrange lists as you like.
    - **Rename:** Give custom names to any list for better organization.
    - **Merge/Split:** If a list contains both movies and series you can merge it into a single Stremio row so it doesn't take up more space than it needs to.
- **Hide/Show from homeview:** Hide lists from homeview, while still accessing them through the Discover tab.
- **Instant Watchlist Updates:** Fetches watchlist content on load.
- **RPDB Support:** Optional RatingPosterDB (RPDB) integration for enhanced poster images across all your lists (requires your own RPDB API key).
- **Configurable Genre Filtering:** If you add too many list you might hit the 8kb manifest size limit. By disabling genre filtering the manifest size should half so you can have more lists.
- **Discovery Lists:** Randomly selected MDBList from a set list of users, a new random list is delivered everytime you refresh the catalog.
- **Share Your Setup:** Generate a shareable hash of your AIOLists configuration (list order, names, imported addons) to share with others.

## Planned Features in Order
- ~~Speed up the loading time of lists in Stremio~~
- ~~Merged and Anime Search~~
- Fix issues:
    - Rework genre filtering
    - Add sorting option for MDBList added without key
- Support for Streams/TV lists from external addons
- Randomize option for lists without sort options
- Better TMDB list support
- Maybe features:
    - Switching Profiles
    - Native Trakt persistance

# Trakt Persistance

Due to the stateless nature of this addon Trakt keys can't automatically update when they expire. I have added an option to make Trakt persistant through Upstash. You can create a free account on there. Here's a short guide:

1. [Create an account](https://upstash.com/), using a temp-mail works fine.
2. After logging in you will be prompted to Create a database press Create Database.
3. Input a Name and the region closest to you.
4. Next -> Next -> Create
5. Scroll down to REST API section and copy UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL and UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN and put them into AIOLists.

Your Trakt tokens are now stored in the redis db and will automatically refresh when they expire.

# Support

If you find this project useful, the best way to support me is to **star this repository** on GitHub!

# Environment Configuration

AIOLists supports several environment variables for advanced configuration:

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# TMDB Configuration  
TMDB_REDIRECT_URI=your_tmdb_redirect_uri_here
TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN=your_tmdb_bearer_token_here
```

### Configuration Details

- **TMDB_REDIRECT_URI**: Redirect URI for TMDB OAuth. When set, users will be redirected after authentication.
- **TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN**: Your TMDB Read Access Token. When set, the bearer token field is hidden in the UI and this token is used automatically.

### Automatic Redirect Behavior

When both `TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN` and redirect URIs are configured, the "Connect to TMDB" button will redirect users directly to the authentication pages instead of showing manual steps.

# Deployment

The easiest way to host this project for free is through hugging face.

**Steps:**
1. Create a huggingface account. https://huggingface.co/
2. Go to https://huggingface.co/new-space?sdk=docker
3. Fill in the Space name and Create Space
4. Scroll down to "Create your Dockerfile" and press "create the Dockerfile" at the bottom of the section.
5. Paste in
    ```bash
    FROM ghcr.io/sebastianmorel/aiolists:latest
    ENV PORT=7860
    ```
6. Press "Commit new file to main"
7. Go to settings and add your TMDB_REDIRECT_URI (username-projectname.hf.space) and TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN
8. Wait for it to finish building and you should have your own instance.

## Deploying on Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.

Most modern PaaS providers that support Docker can deploy AIOLists.
-   **Railway**: Connect your GitHub repository and let Railway build from the `Dockerfile`. Set the `PORT` environment variable if needed (Railway usually injects it).
-   **Render**: Create a new "Web Service", connect your repository, and choose Docker as the environment. Render will build and deploy from the `Dockerfile`. Set the `PORT` environment variable.
-   **Fly.io**: Use the `flyctl` CLI to launch a new app. It can often detect and use your `Dockerfile`.

## Deploy with Docker

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone your fork (or the original repository):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIOLists.git # Replace YOUR_USERNAME if you forked
    cd AIOLists
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t aiolists-addon .
    ```

3.  **Run the container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 7000:7000 -e NODE_ENV=production --restart unless-stopped aiolists-addon
    ```
    Your addon will be available at `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:7000`. You can then access the configuration panel at `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:7000/configure`.

## Deploy on Your Own Node.js Server

You can also run the addon directly with Node.js if you prefer not to use Docker.

1.  **Clone your fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIOLists.git
    cd AIOLists
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install --production
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run prod
    ```
    The server will start on port 7000 by default. Access `/configure`.
